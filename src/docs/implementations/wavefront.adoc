Wavefront is a dimensional monitoring system offered as a SaaS with a full UI, custom query language, and advanced math operations. Wavefront operates on a push model. Metrics may either be pushed through a sidecar process running on the same host (called the Wavefront proxy) or directly to the Wavefront API.

== Configuring

=== Direct to Wavefront

[source,java]
----
WavefrontConfig config = new WavefrontConfig() {
    @Override
    public String uri() {
        return "https://longboard.wavefront.com"; <1>
    }

    @Override
    public String apiToken() {
        return "MYAPIKEY"; <2>
    }

    @Override
    public String get(String key) {
        return null; <3>
    }
};
MeterRegistry registry = new WavefrontMeterRegistry(config, Clock.SYSTEM);
----
<1> "longboard" is the name of the co-tenant instance that most organizations start on. Once you reach a sufficient scale, Wavefront may move you
to a dedicated host.
<2> This is required when pushing directly to Wavefront's API.
<3> Accept the rest of the defaults

=== Through a Wavefront proxy sidecar

[source,java]
----
MeterRegistry registry = new WavefrontMeterRegistry(WavefrontConfig.DEFAULT_PROXY, Clock.SYSTEM);
----

The default proxy configuration will push metrics to a Wavefront proxy sitting on localhost:2878 and histogram distributions to localhost:40000.

NOTE: If publishing metrics to a Wavefront proxy, the URI must be expressed in the form proxy://HOST:PORT.

== Graphing

This section serves as a quickstart to rendering useful representations in Wavefront for metrics originating in Micrometer. See the https://docs.wavefront.com/query_language_getting_started.html[Wavefront docs] for a far more complete reference of what is possible in Wavefront.

=== Counters

The query that generates a graph for a random-walk counter is
`ts(counter)`.

Micrometer pre-computes rates for counters destined for Wavefront.

=== Timers

The Wavefront `Timer` produces several time series:

1. `${name}.avg` - A mean latency for the publishing interval.
2. `${name}.count` - Throughput per second over the publishing interval.
3. `${name}.sum` - Total time per second over the publishing interval (used with `${name}.count`) to create aggregable means.
4. `${name}.percentiles` - Micrometer calculated percentiles for the publishing interval. These cannot be aggregated across dimensions!
5. `${name}.histogram` - Cumulative counts of events less than or equal to SLA boundaries over the publishing interval.

To generate a quick view of latency in Wavefront:

.Timer latency.

This chart demonstrates the average (`ts(timer.avg)` in green), 95th percentile (`ts(timer.percentile, phi="0.95")` in orange), and
max (`ts(timer.max)` in blue).

.Timer throughput.

Additionally, `ts(timer.count)` represents a rate/second throughput of events being timed.

.Timer SLA boundaries.
image::img/wavefront-timer-sla.png[Wavefront-rendered SLA boundaries]

Lastly, if you define SLA boundaries with the fluent builder for `Timer`, you can view throughput below certain SLA boundaries. In this example, we set SLA boundaries at 275 (blue), 300 (orange), and 500 (green) milliseconds for a simulated `Timer` that is recording samples normally distributed around 250 ms. These counts represent the rate/second of samples less than or equal to each SLA boundary.

Where the lines converge at 4:55.30 and 4:57.30 it is evident that no sample exceeded the 275 ms SLA boundary.

=== Wavefront Histograms

When `publishPercentileHistogram` is enabled for a Wavefront `Timer` or `DistributionSummary`, histogram distributions are published to Wavefront. These histogram distributions are aggregated by the minute (the default), hour, and/or day, depending on your `WavefrontConfig`.

To query histograms, use `hs()` queries. For instance, `percentile(98, hs(${name}.m))` returns the 98th percentile for a particular metric over each minute.

See the https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies_histograms.html[Wavefront Histograms documentation] for further reference.
