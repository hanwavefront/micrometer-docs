Wavefront is a dimensional monitoring system offered as a SaaS with a full UI, custom query language, and advanced math operations. Wavefront operates on a push model. Metrics may either be pushed through a sidecar process running on the same host (called the Wavefront proxy) or directly to the Wavefront API.

== Configuring

=== Direct to Wavefront

[source,java]
----
WavefrontConfig config = new WavefrontConfig() {
    @Override
    public String uri() {
        return "https://longboard.wavefront.com"; <1>
    }

    @Override
    public String apiToken() {
        return "MYAPIKEY"; <2>
    }

    @Override
    public String get(String key) {
        return null; <3>
    }
};
MeterRegistry registry = new WavefrontMeterRegistry(config, Clock.SYSTEM);
----
<1> "longboard" is the name of the co-tenant instance that most organizations start on. Once you reach a sufficient scale, Wavefront may move you
to a dedicated host.
<2> This is required when pushing directly to Wavefront's API.
<3> Accept the rest of the defaults

=== Through a Wavefront proxy sidecar

[source,java]
----
MeterRegistry registry = new WavefrontMeterRegistry(WavefrontConfig.DEFAULT_PROXY, Clock.SYSTEM);
----

The default proxy configuration will push metrics and histogram distributions to a Wavefront proxy sitting on localhost:2878.

NOTE: If publishing metrics to a Wavefront proxy, the URI must be expressed in the form proxy://HOST:PORT.

== Graphing

This section serves as a quickstart to rendering useful representations in Wavefront for metrics originating in Micrometer. See the https://docs.wavefront.com/query_language_getting_started.html[Wavefront docs] for a far more complete reference of what is possible in Wavefront.

=== Counters

The query that generates a graph for a random-walk counter is
`ts(counter)`.

Micrometer pre-computes rates for counters destined for Wavefront.

=== Timers

The Wavefront `Timer` produces several time series:

1. `${name}.avg` - A mean latency for the publishing interval.
2. `${name}.count` - Throughput per second over the publishing interval.
3. `${name}.sum` - Total time per second over the publishing interval (used with `${name}.count`) to create aggregable means.
4. `${name}.percentiles` - Micrometer calculated percentiles for the publishing interval. These cannot be aggregated across dimensions!
5. `${name}.histogram` - Cumulative counts of events less than or equal to SLA boundaries over the publishing interval.

To generate a quick view of latency in Wavefront:

.Timer latency.

This chart demonstrates the average (`ts(timer.avg)` in green), 95th percentile (`ts(timer.percentile, phi="0.95")` in orange), and
max (`ts(timer.max)` in blue).

.Timer throughput.

Additionally, `ts(timer.count)` represents a rate/second throughput of events being timed.

.Timer SLA boundaries.
image::img/wavefront-timer-sla.png[Wavefront-rendered SLA boundaries]

Lastly, if you define SLA boundaries with the fluent builder for `Timer`, you can view throughput below certain SLA boundaries. In this example, we set SLA boundaries at 275 (blue), 300 (orange), and 500 (green) milliseconds for a simulated `Timer` that is recording samples normally distributed around 250 ms. These counts represent the rate/second of samples less than or equal to each SLA boundary.

Where the lines converge at 4:55.30 and 4:57.30 it is evident that no sample exceeded the 275 ms SLA boundary.

=== Wavefront Histograms

Wavefront's histogram implementation stores an actual distribution of metrics as opposed to single metrics. This allows you to apply any percentile and aggregation function on the distribution at query time without having to specify specific percentiles and metrics to keep during metric collection.

Wavefront histogram distributions are collected and reported for any `Timer` or `DistributionSummary` that has `publishPercentileHistogram` enabled.

By default, distributions that are reported to Wavefront get aggregated by the minute, providing you with a histogram distribution for each minute. You also have the option of aggregating by hour and/or day. This can be customized via the following configuration options:

* `reportMinuteDistribution` - Boolean specifying whether to aggregate by minute. Enabled by default. Metric name in Wavefront has `.m` suffix.
* `reportHourDistribution` - Boolean specifying whether to aggregate by hour. Disabled by default. Metric name in Wavefront has `.h` suffix.
* `reportDayDistribution` - Boolean specifying whether to aggregate by day. Disabled by default. Metric name in Wavefront has `.d` suffix.

If you are sending to a Wavefront proxy, by default both metrics and histogram distributions will be published to the same port -- 2878 in the default proxy configuration. If your proxy is configured to listen for histogram distributions on a different port, you can specify the port to publish to via the `distributionPort` configuration option.

Histogram distributions can be queried in Wavefront using `hs()` queries. For example, `percentile(98, hs(${name}.m))` returns the 98th percentile for a particular histogram aggregated over each minute. Each histogram metric name has a suffix (`.m`, `.h`, or `.d`) depending on the histogram's aggregation interval.
